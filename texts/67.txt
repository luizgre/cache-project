In the field of computer science, caching is a fundamental technique used to improve system 
performance. A cache stores frequently accessed data in a faster storage layer, reducing the need 
to retrieve data from slower storage. This mechanism is crucial in modern computing systems, from 
web browsers to database management systems. Section 0. Document 67. Cache replacement algorithms determine which items to 
remove when the cache is full and new data needs to be stored. Different algorithms 
have different performance characteristics depending on the access patterns. The choice of algorithm can significantly 
impact the overall system performance and efficiency. Section 0. Document 67. FIFO, or First In First Out, 
is the simplest cache replacement algorithm. It removes the oldest entry in the cache when 
space is needed. While easy to implement, FIFO does not consider how frequently or recently 
an item was accessed. Section 1. Document 67. LRU, or Least Recently Used, removes the item that 
has not been accessed for the longest time. This algorithm assumes that recently accessed items 
are more likely to be accessed again soon. LRU generally provides better performance than FIFO 
for many workloads. Section 1. Document 67. LFU, or Least Frequently Used, tracks how many times each 
item has been accessed. When eviction is needed, it removes the item with the lowest 
access count. This algorithm works well when some items are consistently more popular than others. 
Section 2. Document 67. Understanding cache behavior requires analyzing hit rates and miss rates. A cache hit 
occurs when requested data is found in the cache. A cache miss happens when the 
data must be retrieved from slower storage. Section 2. Document 67. The temporal locality principle states that 
recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again soon. The spatial locality principle suggests 
that data near recently accessed data will likely be accessed next. These principles guide the 
design of effective caching strategies. Section 3. Document 67. Memory hierarchies in computer systems include registers, cache, 
main memory, and disk storage. Each level offers different trade-offs between speed, cost, and capacity. 
Effective caching helps bridge the performance gap between these levels. Section 3. Document 67. In the field
